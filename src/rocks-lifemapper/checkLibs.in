# Purpose: check if OS-provided postgresql-libs rpm is installed as a dependency 
#          of mapserver and remove it. 
#
# NOTE: When yum installs mapserver rpm it installs postgresql-lib rpm which provides
#       dependency libpq.so.5. This happens before yum installs postgresqlXX-libs (alpha 
#       list order) which has a correct verison of libpq.so.5.   Dynamic linker will see 
#       libpq.so.5 from a OS-provided rpm first and calling psql will fail.
# 
# This script must be called after mapserver rpm is installed and before lifemapper
# init tasks are run.  It is called during roll install.
